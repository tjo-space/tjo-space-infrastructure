# `infrastructure.tjo.space`

In this repository (wip) lives everything needed to setup
the `tjo.space` infrastructure.

This is deployed on services provided by `tjo.cloud`. Such as
the Kubernetes (`k8s.tjo.cloud`) and Proxmox (`proxmox.tjo.cloud`) platforms.

By default, services are deployed on Kubernetes, with the exception of services
that require special hardware (video cards etc.).
